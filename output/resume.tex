\startdescription{Programming Languages}
  {\bf Microsoft SQL:} In my current job, I do a lot of work in SQL.
  This work ranges from data uploads to mass alterations of existing
  data. Many investigations require deconstructing scripts and stored
  procedures to assess their outcomes, as well as finding issues across
  the schema and correcting these in a timely manner. I have also been
  active in creating stored procedures for use in our application.

  {\bf PowerShell:} During my time as an SCCM administrator, I made use
  of PowerShell on a daily basis to automate complex tasks and find
  creative solutions to problems posed by our early adoption of Windows
  10 and Microsoft InTune. I wrote a script to automate the process of
  \useURL[url10][https://github.com/Sporiff/Sophos-Install][][deploying
  Sophos AV]\from[url10], which I uploaded to GitHub for other
  administrators to make use of.

  {\bf BASH:} I make heavy use of BASH in both my professional and
  personal life. As a server administrator I operate mostly in BASH and
  BASH scripts, and have made use of several of these scripts to
  automate my personal computers in the same way as my servers.

  {\bf Python:} I have studied Python in my free time using tools such
  as \useURL[url11][https://codecademy.com][][codecademy]\from[url11]
  and have made good use of it in my working life, creating small
  programs to query the Zendesk API to give a notification when
  documents need updating. I also wrote a
  \useURL[url12][https://gitsune.site/Sporiff/tsukumogami][][bot for
  Mastodon]\from[url12] in Python using the Mastodon REST API.

  Basic knowledge of {\bf C}, {\bf .NET}, {\bf Guile Scheme}, {\bf Java}

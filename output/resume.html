<dt>Side Projects</dt>
<dd><p>My passion for technology has led me to undertake many projects independently in order to keep learning and evolving as new technologies emerge.</p>
<ul>
<li>I host my own <a href="https://bakusocial.com" target="_blank">Mastodon instance</a> on DigitalOcean using Docker and Nginx, with Amazon S3 as a media store</li>

</dd>
<dt>Programming Languages</dt>
<dd><strong>Microsoft SQL:</strong> In my current role I do a lot of work in SQL, ranging from data uploads to mass alterations of existing data. Many investigations require deconstructing scripts and stored procedures to assess their outcomes, as well as finding issues across the schema and correcting these in a timely manner. I have also been active in creating stored procedures for use in our application.
</dd>
<dd><p><strong>PowerShell:</strong> During my time as an SCCM administrator, I made use of PowerShell on a daily basis to automate complex tasks and find creative solutions to problems posed by our early adoption of Windows 10 and Microsoft InTune. I wrote a script to automate the process of <a href="https://github.com/Sporiff/Sophos-Install" target="_blank">deploying Sophos AV</a>, which I uploaded to GitHub for other administrators to make use of.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p><strong>BASH:</strong> I make heavy use of BASH in both my professional and personal life. As a server administrator I operate mostly in BASH and BASH scripts, and have made use of several of these scripts to automate my personal computers in the same way as my servers.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p><strong>Python:</strong> I have studied Python in my free time using tools such as <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">codecademy</a> and have made good use of it in my working life, creating small programs to query the Zendesk API to give a notification when documents need updating. I also wrote a <a href="https://gitsune.site/Sporiff/tsukumogami" target="_blank">bot for Mastodon</a> in Python using the Mastodon REST API.</p>
</dd>

Technical Experience
--------------------

**Programming Languages**
:   **Python:** I am fairly proficient in Python and have used it to make both TUI
    and GUI programmes using the GTK framework. I have made contributions to some
    python-based projects including Funkwhale and a few pip libraries

:   **Vue.JS:** As part of my work with the Funkwhale project I have done a lot of
    work with Vue as it is the framework with which we build our web frontend

:   **CSS/HTML:** I have been building websites for many years and have a good grasp
    of both CSS and HTML. I have used both in my personal and professional projects
    such as my personal website, the Funkwhale project, and the web design work undertaken
    at Oneserve

:   **Vanilla JS and jQuery:** I have fallen back on both Vanilla JS and jQuery in
    projects where there have been gaps in the framework or I have had to implement
    features outside of the scope of the platform (e.g. Zendesk)

:   **Microsoft SQL/PostgreSQL:** At Oneserve I primarily work in MSSQL, creating
    stored procedures, triggers, and scripts to automate tasks and augment application
    features for clients. For my personal projects, I tend to use PostgreSQL

:   **PowerShell:** During my time as an SCCM administrator, I made use
    of PowerShell on a daily basis to automate complex tasks and find
    creative solutions to problems posed by our early adoption of Windows 10 across
    the college. I curated scripts for SCCM/Intune management and handling Sophos
    antivirus in a Windows environment which I shared with other SCCM administrators

:   **POSIX Shell:** I make heavy use of BASH in both my professional and personal
    life. As a server administrator I operate mostly in BASH and BASH scripts,
    and have made use of several of these scripts to automate my personal
    computers in the same way as my servers

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **Guile Scheme**, **Java**, **Rust**, **Common Lisp**

---

**Open Source**

:   As a big supporter of Free and Open Source software, I try to help
    out with FOSS projects wherever I can.

:   I am a project maintainer, contributing developer, translator, steering
    committee member, and lead documentation writer for 
    [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio). In this capacity I have contributed 
    new features and bugfixes, and have also led a project to completely overhaul 
    user documentation
:   I am the package maintainer for the [Funkwhale Yunohost package](https://github.com/Yunohost-Apps/funkwhale_ynh)
:   I contribute translations to Japanese, English, and Dutch for various projects 
    on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sporiff)
:   I am the primary en-gb localiser for the [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io)
    project

---

**Side Projects**

:   My passion for technology has led me to undertake many projects independently
    in order to keep learning and evolving as new technologies emerge.
:   I also host a [Tanuki Tunes](https://tanukitunes.com), one of the most
    popular Funkwhale servers (over 300 active users)
:   My [website](https://rootkey.co.uk) is built using Common Lisp and
    an automated git-based deployment system
:   I make use of open source tools to recover data for people who have
    experienced data loss or corruption

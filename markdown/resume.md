Technical Experience

Side Projects
:   My passion for technology has led me to undertake many projects independently
    in order to keep learning and evolving as new technologies present themselves.

    * I host my own [Mastodon instance](https://bakusocial.com) on
      DigitalOcean using Docker and Nginx, with Amazon S3 as a media
      store
    * I also host a [Funkwhale server](https://tanukitunes.com) on
      a similar setup
    * My [website](https://rootkey.co.uk) is built using Hugo and CI
      tools at [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and is hosted publically
      on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sporiff/Rootkey-Website)

Open Source
:   As a big supporter of Free and Open Source software, I try to help
    out with OSS projects wherever I can.

    * I contribute translations to Japanese, English, and Dutch for
      a few projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sporiff)
    * I am the primary en-gb localiser for the [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io)
      project
    * I am active in troubleshooting channels for [GNU Guix](https://gnu.org/software/guix)
      and [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio)

Programming Languages
:   **Microsoft SQL:** In my current job, I do a lot of work in SQL.
    This work ranges from data uploads to mass alterations of existing data.
    Many investigations require deconstructing scripts and stored procedures
    to assess their outcomes, as well as finding issues across the schema
    and correcting these in a timely manner. I have also been active in creating
    stored procedures for use in our application.

:   **PowerShell:** During my time as an SCCM administrator, I made use
    of PowerShell on a daily basis to automate complex tasks and find
    creative solutions to problems posed by our early adoption of Windows
    10 and Microsoft InTune. I wrote a script to automate the process of
    [deploying Sophos AV](https://github.com/Sporiff/Sophos-Install),
    which I uploaded to GitHub for other administrators to make use of.
    
:   **BASH:** I make heavy use of BASH in both my professional and personal
    life. As a server administrator I operate mostly in BASH and BASH scripts,
    and have made use of several of these scripts to automate my personal
    computers in the same way as my servers.

:   **Python:** I have studied Python in my free time using tools such as
    [codecademy](https://codecademy.com) and have made good use of it in my working life, 
    creating small programs to query the Zendesk API to give a notification when
    documents need updating. I also wrote a [bot for Mastodon](https://gitsune.site/Sporiff/tsukumogami)
    in Python using the Mastodon REST API.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **.NET**, **Guile**, **Java**
